- CommonJS:
1 - If there's an error reading the file: The output will be as you correctly stated:
   nextTick 1
   promise 1
   setTimeout 1
   there is an error. can not read from file
   setImmediate 1

   else : 

   nextTick 1
   promise 1
   setTimeout 1
   setImmediate 1
   [content of input.txt]

- ES6 :
 
    promise 1
    nextTick 1
    setImmediate 1
    setTimeout 1
    [content of input.txt] OR there is an error. can not read from file
